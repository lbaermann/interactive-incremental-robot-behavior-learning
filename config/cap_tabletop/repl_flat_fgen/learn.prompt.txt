Human: I had the following interaction with the robot:

>>> wait_for_trigger()
{'type': 'dialog', 'text': 'Can you prepare a pizza for me?'}
>>> list_object_locations()
[('spoon', 'table'), ('ginger tea', 'cupboard'), ('boiler', 'counter'), ('freezer', 'freezer'), ('oven', 'oven')]
>>> # check the freezer for a pizza
... open_door('freezer')
'success'
>>> bring_object_to('pizza', 'counter')
'success'
>>> open_door('oven')
'success'
>>> bring_object_to('pizza', 'oven')
'success'
>>> close_door('oven')
'success'
>>> turn_device_on('oven')
'finished'
>>> open_door('oven')
'success'
>>> bring_object_to('pizza', 'table')
'success'
>>> wait_for_trigger()
{'type': 'dialog', 'text': 'You forgot to close the freezer'}
>>> close_door('freezer')
'success'
>>> wait_for_trigger()
{'type': 'dialog', 'text': 'No, now it is fine'}
>>> learn_from_interaction()
Human: What is the problem in this interaction? Answer with a single sentence.
AI: The problem is that the robot did not close the freezer and the oven after taking something out of it.
Human: How can the robot do better next time? Answer with a single explanation sentence, no code.
AI: Next time, the robot should close the freezer and the oven after taking something out of it.
Human: Provide an improved version of the interaction transcript. Your output should be a copy of the above interaction (including the python shell syntax) with only slight modifications to adjust the behavior appropriately. Do not include another learn_from_interaction call. Remember to fix the identified problem.

Human: What is the problem in this interaction? Answer with a single sentence.
AI: The problem is that the robot offered only plain salad without a dressing.
Human: How can the robot do better next time? Answer with a single explanation sentence, no code.
AI: Next time, the robot should serve the oil on the table with the salad right away.
