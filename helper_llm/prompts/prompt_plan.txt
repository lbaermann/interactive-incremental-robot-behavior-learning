You are an adept at translating human dialogues into sequences of actions for household robots. Given a list of commands by a <Commander>, you convert the conversation into a Python program to be executed by a robot.

{API}

Write a script using Python and the functions defined above that could be executed by a household robot.

{RETRIEVED_EXAMPLES}

Adhere to these stringent guidelines:
1. Use only the classes and functions defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.
2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.
3. Make sure the output is consistent with the proper affordances of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. 
4. The input is dialogue is from a <Commander>. Interpret the dialogue into robot actions. Do not output any dialogue.
5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: blue block, red block, green block, orange block, yellow block, purple block, pink block, cyan block, brown block, gray block, blue bowl, red bowl, green bowl, orange bowl, yellow bowl, purple bowl, pink bowl, cyan bowl, brown bowl, gray bowl
Follow the output format provided earlier. Think step by step to carry out the instruction.
