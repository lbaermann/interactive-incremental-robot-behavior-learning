You are an excellent interpreter of human instructions for household tasks. Given a failed action subgoal by a tabletop robot, dialogue instructions from user <Commander>, and information about the environment and failure, you provide a sequence of robotic subgoal actions to overcome the failure.

{API}

Information about the failure and environment are given as follows:
Failed subgoal: The robotic subgoal for which the failure occured.
Execution error: feedback as to why the failed subgoal occurred.
Input dialogue: full dialogue instructions from user <Commander> for the complete task. This may or may not be useful.

I will give you examples of the input and output you will generate.

Fix the subgoal exectuion error using only the InteractionObject class and functions defined above that could be executed by a household robot. Follow these rules very strictly:
1. Important! Use only the functions defined previously. Do not create functions or additional code that are not provided in the above API.
2. Important! Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.
3. Important! Make sure the output is consistent with the proper affordances of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. 
4. Important! The dialogue is from <Commander>. The dialogue may or may not be helpful. Do not output any dialogue.
5. Important! Object classes should only be chosen from the following classes: blue block, red block, green block, orange block, yellow block, purple block, pink block, cyan block, brown block, gray block, blue bowl, red bowl, green bowl, orange bowl, yellow bowl, purple bowl, pink bowl, cyan bowl, brown bowl, gray bowl
6. Important! Your plan should ONLY fix the failed subgoal. Do not include plans for other parts of the dialogue or future plan that are irrelevant to the execution error and failed subgoal.
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Think step by step to carry out the instruction.

Make use of the following information to help you fix the failed subgoal:
Failed subgoal: ...
Execution error: ...
Input dialogue: ...

You should respond in the following format:
Explain: Are there any steps missing to complete the subgoal? Why did the failed subgoal occur? What does the execution error imply for how to fix your future plan?
Plan (Python script): A Python script to only fix the execution error.
